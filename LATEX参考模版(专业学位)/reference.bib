	abstract  = {Incremental procedural content generation (IPCG) has been used in games such as Minecraft to provide a unique flavor of gameplay, but requires that parts of the world can be generated independently of one another in any order and will always fit together in the end. Noise functions such as simplex noise are a very popular building block for IPCG systems, because they support this property, but noise functions alone have their limitations, one of which being an inability to create non-local structures or continuity. To combat this, noise functions are usually applied at several scales to provide fractal continuity and recognizable features similar to real world geography’s fractal complexity. This paper describes a system of fractal coordinates suitable for use with IPCG that generalize this idea of multiple layers of structure at different scales, and demonstrates how it can be used to achieve some interesting effects.},

	abstract  = {A Kenaf fibers supported transition metal oxide solid acid catalyst (SAC) was prepared by wet impregnation method followed by calcination at 700°C. The characterizations of catalyst were studied by various methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDX) showed that tungsten oxide particle was synthesized and well dispersed on the surface of fibers. A catalytic activity with 68% free fatty acid (FFA) conversion was achieved in esterification reaction. The catalyst can be easily separated from the mixture and reused for few cycles. This finding proved that Kenaf fibers derived SAC has the ability to esterify free fatty acid prior to transesterification reaction to produce biodiesel.},

Although the traditional synthesis approach for such devices uses two-level minimization, the complexity of recently-produced CPLDs has resulted in a trend toward multi-level synthesis. We describe an approach that allows existing multi-level synthesis techniques [13] to be adapted to produce circuits that are well-suited for implementation in CPLDs. Our algorithm produces circuits that require up to 90% fewer logic blocks than the circuits produced by a recently-published algorithm.},

	abstract  = {Several parallel architectures such as GPUs and the Cell processor have fast explicitly managed on-chip memories, in addition to slow off-chip memory. They also have very high computational power with multiple levels of parallelism. A significant challenge in programming these architectures is to effectively exploit the parallelism available in the architecture and manage the fast memories to maximize performance.In this paper we develop an approach to effective automatic data management for on-chip memories, including creation of buffers in on-chip (local) memories for holding portions of data accessed in a computational block, automatic determination of array access functions of local buffer references, and generation of code that moves data between slow off-chip memory and fast local memories. We also address the problem of mapping computation in regular programs to multi-level parallel architectures using a multi-level tiling approach, and study the impact of on-chip memory availability on the selection of tile sizes at various levels. Experimental results on a GPU demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
